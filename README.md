**Sign Language Recognition Model**

### **Introduction**
This project focuses on developing a **sign language recognition model** using deep learning techniques. It integrates **Mediapipe** for feature extraction and **LSTM-based neural networks** to classify gestures based on video input. The model aims to enhance accessibility by enabling real-time recognition of sign language.

### **Workflow Overview**
1. **Data Collection & Processing:**
   - The notebook starts by installing necessary dependencies and importing key libraries, including **Mediapipe, OpenCV, NumPy, and PyTorch**.
   - It extracts hand, pose, and face landmarks from sign language videos and stores them as structured numerical data.
   
2. **Feature Extraction & Storage:**
   - Each frame is processed using **Mediapipe Holistic Model**, detecting key landmarks.
   - Extracted landmarks are saved as **NumPy (.npy) files**, creating a dataset for training.

3. **Model Development:**
   - The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
   - A **multi-layer LSTM model** is implemented using PyTorch, consisting of stacked LSTMs and fully connected layers.
   - Optimization techniques such as **dropout, layer normalization, and learning rate scheduling** are applied to improve performance.

4. **Training & Evaluation:**
   - The model is trained on gesture sequences with **cross-entropy loss** and **SGD optimizer with momentum**.
   - Early stopping prevents overfitting by monitoring validation loss.
   - The trained model is evaluated using accuracy metrics, ensuring high reliability in recognizing sign gestures.

5. **Prediction & Deployment:**
   - The model can infer sign language gestures from new video inputs.
   - Future improvements include **real-time inference integration** and **deployment via API or mobile applications**.

### **Conclusion**
This notebook presents a **structured pipeline** for sign language recognition, leveraging **deep learning and computer vision**. The combination of **Mediapipe for feature extraction** and **LSTM for sequence modeling** makes it effective for gesture classification. Further refinements can enhance real-time recognition performance, making it a valuable tool for accessibility solutions.
